# FDFDT
FAIR Data for Digital Twins

### Description
A collaborative project by DANS and NIOO about describing the workflow of making (long-tail) ecological data [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) (findable, accessible, interoperable, reusable). This project is a pilot for [LTER-LIFE](https://lter-life.nl/en), a large scale research infrastructure project that will facilitate the development of digital workflows and digital twins of entire ecosystems, in which both DANS and NIOO are partners.

### Project partners
- Cees Hof / DANS-KNAW
- Wim Hugo / DANS-KNAW
- [Cherine Jantzen](https://github.com/CherineJ) / NIOO-KNAW
- Marcel Visser / NIOO-KNAW
- [Stefan Vriend](https://github.com/StefanVriend) / NIOO-KNAW

### Deliverables
- [ ] FAIR and mobilised datasets
- [ ] Manual: how to FAIRify long-tail ecological data?
- [ ] Workshop
- [ ] Data type registry at DANS' Data Station

### Datasets  
A number of datasets of various origin, complexity, and structure will be made FAIR as part of this project.  
Also see: NIOO-DANS Dataset Selection ([Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1G6mWBRksBo3pVoereOFnTii8pJdH_x-9di6silDFMEI/edit)).

### Veluwe proto-DT
This project runs simultaneously to the start-up phase of LTER-LIFE. As such, we put the things we learned in this project to the test by developing a full but simplified workflow that might resemble the envisioned LTER-LIFE experience - a prototype digital twin. This proto-DT focusses on the timing of oak bud burst, derived from NIOO's bud burst dataset (i.e., the first dataset FAIRified as part of FDFDT), in relation to mean temperatures, derived from KNMI, visualised in the virtual research environment (VRE) built by LifeWatch; see [https://github.com/QCDIS/NaaVRE](https://github.com/QCDIS/NaaVRE).
